This is a  program  which was designed as part of my "30-Day Python Challenge." 


Functionalities of functions:
1. show_intro():
   - This Function to represent introduction of this assignment / Project. Starting with a little welcome message.

2. dataStructuresInPy Dictionary:
   - A dictionary where each key is a data structure's name (list, set, tuple, dict).
   - Each key in dictionary having values which represents:
     - description: A brief explanation of the data structure.
     - use_case: Examples of real-life scenarios where the data structure might be used.
     - pros: A list of advantages.
     - cons: A list of disadvantages.

3. dataStructuresInPyInfo(ds_key):
   - Takes a key (ds_key) that corresponds to one of the data structures.
   - Retrieves and displays detailed information about the specified data structure if it exists in the dataStructuresInPy dictionary.
   - Displays the description, use case, pros, and cons in a formatted manner.
   - If the key is not found, it displays an error msg.

4. main():
   - Calls show_intro() to display the introduction msg.
   - Enters a loop that prompts the user to select a data structure to explore from a menu.
   - Based on the user input, calls dataStructuresInPyInfo() with the appropriate key ("list", "set", "tuple", or "dict").
   - If the user chooses "5", it exits the loop.
   - Handles invalid input by prompting the user to try again.

5. Execution Block:
   - Starting point: The script is designed to run when executed directly. The conditional if __name__ == "__main__": main() ensures that main() is called only when the script is run as a standalone program, not when imported as a module.

Usage:
- Users interact with the program through a simple text-based interface.
- They select options by entering numbers corresponding to each data structure or choosing to exit.
