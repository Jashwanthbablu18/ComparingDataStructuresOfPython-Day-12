# 📊 Day 12 - Data Structure Comparison CLI

Hello and welcome to **Day 12** of my **#30DaysOfPythonChallenge**!  
Today’s project is a **Data Structure Comparison CLI** that makes exploring Python's fundamental data types simple and intuitive.

---

## 📌 Topic
**Comparing Python’s Core Data Structures:**
- 📋 **List**
- 📦 **Tuple**
- 🧮 **Set**
- 🗂️ **Dictionary**

---

## 🧠 What I Built
A command-line app that:
- Lets users choose a data structure
- Shows a comparison of:
  - Definition
  - Syntax
  - Real-world use cases
  - Advantages and limitations
- Acts as a mini reference guide while learning Python

---

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- `dict` for storing structured metadata
- `input()` and loops for interactivity
- Clean CLI navigation
- Conditional logic for dynamic content

---

## 🚀 How to Use
Run the script:
```bash
python Day-12Code.py
